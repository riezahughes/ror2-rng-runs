# Risk of Rain 2 RNG run Generator.

Pretty simple premise. Just takes the number of players involved and picks artifacts for you. Really simple API. For use in a bit of everything.

Available at: (riskofpain.co.uk)[http://riskofpain.co.uk]

frontend: Netlify
backend: nginx

## TO DO:

- [ ] Refactor API app so it's less convoluded in places and reads better.
- [ ] Write Documentation for the single rest call.
- [ ] Start working on a discord bot to display the data.
- [ ] Dockerize the lot of this.
- [ ] Native app for this maybe? Idk. It's been a while since i've done one.

#### Frontend Stuff:
- [ ] Create a Settings Section that pops up at the top. Allow to pick between total artifacts, players and take a discord webhook to post straight to a channel.
- [ ] Make it less bulky on the screen (helps with the above removing the sliders)
- [ ] Set up modal and animations
- [ ] SPIN THE WHEEL style of selection for the results screen.
- [ ] Generic "Made by X" stuff.
- [ ] Add skills to frontend to choose between them as well.
