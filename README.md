# Risk of Rain 2 RNG run Generator.

Pretty simple premise. Just takes the number of players involved and picks artifacts for you. Really simple API. For use in a bit of everything.

## TO DO:

- [ ] Refactor API app so it's less convoluded in places and reads better.
- [ ] Write Documentation for the single rest call.
- [ ] Start working on a simple frontend to display the data.
- [ ] Start working on a discord bot to display the data.
- [ ] Dockerize the lot of this.
- [ ] Native app for this maybe? Idk. It's been a while since i've done one.
